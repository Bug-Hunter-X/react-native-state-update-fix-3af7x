This error occurs when you are using a state variable inside a function component in React Native and try to modify it directly using the assignment operator (=). React Native components use a mechanism called "state" to manage their data and UI updates. Modifying the state directly will not trigger a re-render of the component, leading to the UI not updating to reflect the changes. This can lead to unexpected behavior and make debugging difficult.
